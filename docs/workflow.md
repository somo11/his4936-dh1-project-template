# Workflow

Our group decided to do research on the amount of United States casualties in the second World War. As we began our research, certain tasks were divided amoung the two of us in order to breakdown the project. Amoung these tasks, Tony was in charge of gathering data, writing the historiography and analyzing all of the raw data. Steven was choosen as the group leader and was in charge of collecting all the data, uploading the data sent from Tony in GitHub, creating visualizations. Once the tasks were divided, our group came into some conflicting issues, causing the two of us to overlap on workflow topics.
