# Problems and Possibilities

When our group began our research, we believed most of our information would be obtained through the United States National Archives and Records database. This data base had almost all of the information needed to be able to create visualizations that would enhance our findings and clearly deliver the information. However, we quickly found out that the information we were trying to access could not be scraped via web scraper io. This ultimately brought our group to a cross road on whether we wanted to manually input all the data we received from the National Archives and Records or to pursue other data bases and restart our research. 
Our group decided to to continue using the data found in the National Archives and Records while inputting the data manually. Once we had a basic understanding that we wanted to pursue our research in WWII statistics, our group narrowed down the focus to just the United States. Initially, we thought that we could find information in the National Archives and Records regarding soldiers who were enlisted and soldiers who were drafted. When trying to gather data regarding enlistments, the task began much harder than initially thought. All of the sources we researched could not give a definitive number of draftees versus enlistees. The closest we came to finding soldiers that were drafted were located in subscription based ancestral websites. 
When we discovered that comparing the death toll of the soldiers who were drafted to those who were enlisted, we were very upset because we were interested in finding out for ourselves as well as creating more visuals for our research. At this point our group came together to find an alternative direction to take our project. 
Since we hit a dead end with draftees and enlistees, we decided to stay with U.S. casualties by state. Though to enhance our research, we included a visualization of all casualties in WWII by country in our introduction as a segway to our focus of the United States.

This section serves as your sort-of conclusion/summary. Not a summary of the historical subject, but a summary of the process of the project itself. By discussing where you hit roadblocks and where you wish you could go if you had more time, you leave future individuals something to build on.

You should talk about where you group encountered the most difficulties. What was the hardest about scraping, or visualizing, or locating historiography? Did you have problems communicating or sharing files on GitHub?

What problems stopped you dead in the water? Did you have to change course mid-project to account for data that you could not get, or was not what you thought?

Moving on from problems, let's the reader on a positive note. What worked best, where did you think the strength of the project was? What were the most useful historical insights? What were the most useful tools?

Finally, think of future attempts to continue this line of research, whether by yourself or others. Where do you want to go with it. What areas do you think could be expanded easily? You can discuss what you wish you could have done but could not due to lack of time/skill/et.c. But, much more than that, what would you suggest would be the most useful thing(s) you think could actually be accomplished in the space of another semester?
