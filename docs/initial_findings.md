The bar graph at the bottom of this dashboard reaffirms the previous world map color intensity chart showing China and the Soviet Union with the heaviest total death toll. When we separated the data from the total death toll and divided it by military and civilian deaths, we found some very interesting differences. First, we noticed that Chinaâ€™s death toll drastically dropped when looking only at their military losses. Another interesting change was with Poland. While Poland disappeared amongst the smaller bubbles in the military chart with their 240,000 military casualties, it exploded on the civilian chart ranking third in civilian deaths with just over 5.3 million.

The total death toll between all U.S. Military branches is depicted above. As shown in the darker blue colors, New York suffered the most casualties with over 36,000. Pennsylvania comes in at a close second with just over 30,000. California, Chicago, Ohio, and Texas suffer the next most casualties.

This visualization more closely resembles our first one with total death toll in all military branches. From this, we are able to easily conclude that the Army, which encompassed the Air Force during WWII, suffered over 80% of the United States casualties in the war.

When we broke down the U.S. casualties into Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, we were surprised to find such a lopsided casualty count when compared to the Army and Air Force casualties in the next visualization below. Of the total 373,000 casualties in our National Archives database, only around 65,000 came from the Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. Interestingly, though, California came in first with the heaviest death toll amongst the military branches above at just under 7,000.
