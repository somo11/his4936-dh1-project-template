Our research topic is American WW2 casualties by military branch and by U.S. state. We would like to explore some interesting questions of which states contained the most casualties in the war as well as which branches of the military. There are a few other questions that we will bring up through visualizations that we otherwise might not have been able to see or answer without such methods. We also added in a few other casualty databases from the rest of the countries involved in WWll to use as an interesting reference for comparison.
