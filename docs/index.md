The second World War took place between 1939-1945. It was and still is the deadliest conflict in world history to date. By the war’s end in 1945, the world had lost somewhere between 50 and 70 million soldiers and civilians combined. The United States was forced into the war on the morning of December 7, 1941 after the Japanese launched a surprise aerial attack on the American Naval fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The U.S. would spend the next three years fighting the Axis powers in a multi-front war ranging from, but not limited to, the Nazis in Europe, the Japanese in the Pacific, and the Italians in North Africa. When the Axis powers were finally defeated, the United States military had suffered just over 400,000 casualties. In this project, we will show American WWII casualties in each state by using digital visualizations. First and foremost, we hope to break away from the traditional, and often times, one-dimensional approach to body counts. Secondly, we want to show the United States’ casualties in a way that’s more than just an emotionally detached number on a page. In visualizing these casualties by particular state, our aim is to bring the deaths of these American heroes a little closer to home.
