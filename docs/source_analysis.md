## Data Analysis

The most important thing we would like to note is that for purposes of using a visualizing program like tableau, we had to choose a specific number of casualties due to tableau not being able to clean casualty data from some countries with contested casualty figures. To solve this problem, as one of our sources also did, we averaged the most common minimum and maximum casualty figures agreed upon in most historical works and entered that averaged number into the Excel spreadsheet. For example, Germanyâ€™s total death toll is estimated between 6.6 and 8.8 million so we used 7.7 million as our data entry. By doing this, Tableau was finally able to use the data we uploaded. It is in this sence that the data collection for this project does or can play a big role in how the data is constructed. The sources we collected did not use any data visualization tools, the sources ranged from rough casualty estimates to specifice figures.
